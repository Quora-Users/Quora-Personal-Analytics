Use to only analyze *your* personal Quora account. Read [Quora's TOS](http://www.quora.com/about/tos).

Need to be running Ruby 1.8.7 with Firefox 3.6. I have only tested code under OS X Snow Leopard.

Expects there to be a /Quora-Personal-Analytics folder inside your home directory.

Running "bundle install" should get everything necessary except the [JSSH Firefox Extenstion](http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir+Installation#FireWatirInstallation-2%29InstalltheJSSHFirefoxExtension) which you must install.

To run the code in current incarnation, you'll need to start Firefox with the JSSH flag enabled. For OS X it will look like: /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -jssh

Grab all your data as HTML files: ruby QuoraCrawler.rb "firstname-lastname" (ex. firstname-lastname from http://quora.com/*firstname-lastname*/. You might need a number like firstname-lastname-1).

Process your data using: ruby QuoraStats.rb "firstname-lastname"

Right now QuoraStats.rb is only outputting limited detail, but if you call the loadalldata method on a QuoraUser object in irb, then you can play around with extracting out all the data that interests you. (ex: user = QuoraUser.new('firstname-lastname') ; user.loadalldata ; user.answers[0].content.text.length => user's first answer's content length)
